# constructor-game

## SQUARES ARE GOING DOWN AND UP 
- make canvas (full screen)
- make file for Squares.js
- add a square to the canvas using the constructor function
- make the square move

## SAVE FOR LATER
-There are four columns of shapes; they each get faster
-There is a shape you need to collect at the end
- You cannot touch the moving shapes
-If you touch the shape, you lose 
-If you get the shape you need to collect, you win!
